<h2>Directions</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    In a large skillet, melt 2 tablespoons butter over medium heat. Add
    pancetta, onion, carrot, and celery and cook, stirring often, for 10 minutes
    or until lightly browned. Transfer to a heavy large saucepan.
  </li>

  <li>
    In same skillet, heat olive oil. Cook ground beef and pork over medium heat,
    stirring to break up any lumps, until browned. Pour in the wine, increase
    the heat and boil briskly, stirring constantly, until almost all of the
    liquid has evaporated. Transfer ground meat mixture to the saucepan with the
    pancetta and vegetables. Set skillet aside.
  </li>

  <li>
    Stir the beef stock and tomato paste into the saucepan. Bring sauce to a
    boil over high heat, then reduce the heat and simmer, partially covered, for
    45 minutes, stirring occasionally.
  </li>

  <li>
    Meanwhile, melt remaining 2 tablespoons of butter over medium-high heat in
    the original skillet. Add chicken livers and saute for 3 to 4 minutes, or
    until firm and lightly browned. Remove livers from skillet and dice. Set
    aside and add to sauce 10 minutes before it is done. A few minutes before
    serving, stir in the cream and let it heat through. Season sauce with
    nutmeg, salt, and pepper to taste.
